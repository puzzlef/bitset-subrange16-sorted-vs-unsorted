Testing the effectiveness of **sorted** vs **unsorted** list of integers for BitSet.

This experiment was for comparing performance between:
1. Read graph edges to **sorted bitset** based DiGraph & transpose.
2. Read graph edges to **unsorted bitset** based DiGraph & transpose.

Each approach was attempted on a number of temporal graphs, running each with
multiple batch sizes (`1`, `5`, `10`, `50`, ...). Each batch size was run with 5
different updates to graph, and each specific update was run 5 times for each
approach to get a good time measure. **Transpose** of DiGraph based on
**sorted bitset** is clearly **faster** than the *unsorted* one. However, with
**reading graph edges** there is no clear winner (sometimes *sorted* is
*faster* especially for large graphs, and sometimes *unsorted*). Maybe when
new edges have many duplicates, **inserts are less**, and hence sorted version
is faster (since sorted bitset has slow insert time).

All outputs are saved in [out](out/) and a small part of the output is listed
here. Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets]. The input
data used for this experiment is available at the
[Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection].
